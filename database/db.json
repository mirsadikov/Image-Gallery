However, with its maritime climate and the unpredictability of the rain showers you should pack waterproof layers and an umbrella regardless of when you visit. The rainiest season is autumn (September to November), so if you want an outdoorsy trip, avoid visiting during that time.","time":1617561613676},{"id":"_yzzlfajzi","title":"Hello Samarkand","path":"/images/_uxg9tpibk.jpeg","description":"Samarkand also known as Samarqand, is a city in southeastern Uzbekistan and among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Central Asia. There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic Era, though there is no direct evidence of when Samarkand was founded; several theories propose that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BC. Prospering from its location on the Silk Road between China and the Mediterranean Sea, at times Samarkand was one of the largest cities of Central Asia","time":1617173746089},{"id":"_01j5j30hi","title":"Amazing Urungach","path":"/images/_uz8xubwmg.jpeg","description":"Urungach lakes are situated just 160 km from the Tashkent. The lakes are located in the Ugam-Chatcal National Nature Park in rather hard to reach territory. Though being not that far from Tashkent it takes around 4-5 hours to reach the place as the condition of roads is just terrible. Ravines, boulders, talus, sometimes no road surface at all and steep ascents and descents force the transport to move at a speed not exceeding 20 km/h. This creates a feeling of even greater remoteness of the lakes.","time":1617266655500}]
